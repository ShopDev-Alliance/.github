# Welcome to ShopDev Alliance 

ShopDev Alliance is a premium Slack Community for experienced Shopify Developers co-founded by [David Lindahl](https://x.com/austriker27) and [Taylor Page](https://x.com/TRPage_dev). 

This is a space for solo operators supporting merchants on Shopify can gather in a moderated community with a Code of Conduct, free of spam and other bothers that distract you from shipping. We aim to be as valuable a resource as the Shopify Partner Slack, just without the spam.

In the future, we have goals to provide code snippets and resources for members to easily access best tips and tricks of the trade.

See you in there ðŸ«¡
